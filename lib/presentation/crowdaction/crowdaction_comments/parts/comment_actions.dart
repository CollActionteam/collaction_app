/// A list of all actions that can be displayed about or done on a comment.
///
/// These include:-
///  - The comment date can be Today or the yyyy-mm-dd formatted date
///  of the comment. (TODO: The date formatting isn't yet confirmed from design)
///  - The number of likes, this displays the like count only when it's 1 or more.
///  - Reply option, this requests focus to the comment text field, keeping a
///  record of which comment is being responded to.
///  - Flag option [CollactionIcons.flag] when not flagged and
///  [CollactionIcons.flag_filled] when the issue is flagged.
///  (TODO: Functionality flow is also unconfirmed)
///  - Like, which displays [CollactionIcons.heart] when a comment is not yet
///  liked by the current user and [CollactionIcons.heart_filled] in [Colors.red]
///  when the current user has liked the comment.
///  - Delete, this replaces Like when the current user is the comment author.
///  It displays a [CollactionIcons.trash] and when tapped asks confirmation
///  before deleting comment.
///
